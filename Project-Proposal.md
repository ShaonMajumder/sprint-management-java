## Introduction :

We propose to develop a sprint management tool to help teams organize and track our sprints more effectively. The proposed sprint management system will provide a centralized location to manage and track project progress, create and manage sprints, and assign tasks to team members.

## Objectives :

The objectives of the sprint management system are as follows:

- Provide a centralized location for project management
- Create and manage sprints
- Assign tasks to team members
- Track project progress
- Monitor team member workload and capacity
- Provide project analytics and reporting

## Scope :

The scope of the sprint management system will include the following features:

- User login
- Project creation and management
- Sprint creation and management
- Task assignment and tracking
- Team member workload monitoring
- Analytics and reporting

## Methodology:

We will use an Agile methodology to develop the sprint management system. We will work in sprints, with each sprint lasting two weeks. We will hold daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress and address any issues or roadblocks. We will use a combination of Scrum and Kanban methodologies to manage our tasks and workflow.

## Features

The tool will have the following features:

- User login
- Project creation, update, archive, and management
- Task creation, update, archive, and management
- Sprint creation, update, archive, and management
- Set due dates and assign team members for tasks
- Project, Sprint and Task Progress Tracking
- Team member workload monitoring
- Generate sprint reports

## Technologies

The sprint management tool will be developed using the following technologies:

- Front-end: Java UI Frames
- Back-end: Java and Mysql
- ORM : Hibernate
- Build Tools : Maven

## Deliverables:

The deliverables for this project will include:

- A fully functional sprint management system
- User manual
- Technical documentation
- Training for users

## Project Timeline:

The project will be completed in two sprint, each lasting two weeks. The timeline for each sprint is as follows:
