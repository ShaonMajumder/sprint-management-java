## Introduction :
We propose to develop a sprint management tool to help teams organize and track our sprints more effectively. The proposed sprint management system will provide a centralized location to manage and track project progress, create and manage sprints, and assign tasks to team members.

## Objectives :
The objectives of the sprint management system are as follows:

- Provide a centralized location for project management
- Create and manage sprints
- Assign tasks to team members
- Track project progress
- Monitor team member workload and capacity
- Provide project analytics and reporting

## Scope :
The scope of the sprint management system will include the following features:

- User login
- Project creation and management
- Sprint creation and management
- Task assignment and tracking
- Team member workload monitoring
- Analytics and reporting

## Methodology:
We will use an Agile methodology to develop the sprint management system. We will work in sprints, with each sprint lasting two weeks. We will hold daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress and address any issues or roadblocks. We will use a combination of Scrum and Kanban methodologies to manage our tasks and workflow.

## Features
The tool will have the following features:
- User login
- Project creation, update, archive, and management
- Task creation, update, archive, and management
- Sprint creation, update, archive, and management
- Set due dates and assign team members for tasks
- Project, Sprint and Task Progress Tracking
- Team member workload monitoring
- Generate sprint reports

## Technologies
The sprint management tool will be developed using the following technologies:
- Front-end: Java UI Frames
- Back-end: Java and Mysql

## Deliverables:
The deliverables for this project will include:

- A fully functional sprint management system
- User manual
- Technical documentation
- Training for users

## Project Timeline: Edit
The project will be completed in two sprint, each lasting two weeks. The timeline for each sprint is as follows:

### Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-4)
- Develop user interface
- Implement basic functionality for creating and managing sprints

### Sprint 2 (Weeks 5-8)
- Implement task assignment and tracking functionality
- Integrate with project management tools

### Sprint 3 (Weeks 9-12)
- Implement sprint reporting functionality
- Test and debug the application
- Deploy the application to production


Planning and design phase (2 weeks)
Development phase (12 weeks)
Testing and debugging phase (2 weeks)
Deployment and training phase (2 weeks)
Project Budget:
The budget for this project will be $100,000. This will include the cost of development, testing, deployment, and training.
